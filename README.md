Arithmetica is a general-purpose infinite precision Linux and windows math library with a wide variety of mathematical functions and features. Currently supported languages are C, C++, and Python.

# Documentation
The documentation for arithmetica can be found [here](https://arithmetica-org.github.io/arithmetica-docs/)!

# Demonstration
Using [construct_regular_polygon.c](https://github.com/avighnac/arithmetica/blob/main/src/library/geometry/construct_regular_polygon.c), you can create and render polygons.

## Python

### Using pip!

If you're on or above Python 3.10, then pip will work for you. See below if not.
```shell
pip install arithmetica-py
```

### Using binaries
Go to the [project page](https://pypi.org/project/arithmetica-py/) on PyPi and download the built distributions. Use pip to install the .whl file as per your operating system.

## C/C++

### Linux
Linux users are in luck! If you're on Linux, then you can automatically copy the '.a', '.so', '.h', and '.hpp' to `/usr/include` with one command! Note that you will also need to [install basic_math_operations](https://github.com/avighnac/basic_math_operations): this can be done similarly.

```shell
curl -s -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw" https://api.github.com/repos/avighnac/arithmetica/contents/install.sh | sudo bash
```

### Windows

Include the header [arithmetica.h]() and download the `.a` file from the [releases section](https://github.com/avighnac/arithmetica/releases/).
```c
#include "arithmetica.h"

// your code here
// ...
```
This library uses [basic_math_operations](https://github.com/avighnac/basic_math_operations) for infinite precision arithmetic.
To compile a program using [arithmetica](https://github.com/avighnac/arithmetica), do the following:
## Command line
[Download basic_math_operations](https://github.com/avighnac/basic_math_operations/releases/) in a similar manner. However, you do not have to include any headers for [basic_math_operations](https://github.com/avighnac/basic_math_operations). Use the following command to compile:
`gcc/g++ filename.cpp/c [your arguments] -L. -larithmetica -lbasic_math_operations`
## CMake
Clone [basic_math_operations](https://github.com/avighnac/basic_math_operations) and [arithmetica](https://github.com/avighnac/arithmetica) using `git`, or download the repositories. If your project is on GitHub, then use [submodules](https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/) to prevent cluttering your language statistics. In either case, the repositories should be present in your project's base folder (or any subfolders in that base folder).

In your _base_ `CMakeLists.txt` file, include the following lines of code:
```cmake
# your previous CMake code here
# ...

# replace path_pointing_to_cloned_repo with the actual path 
add_subdirectory(path_pointing_to_cloned_repo_arithmetica)
add_subdirectory(path_pointing_to_cloned_repo_basic_math_operations)
```

Then, in your `CMakeLists.txt` responsible for compiling your executable, add these lines of code:
```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_project_name_here PRIVATE arithmetica)
target_link_libraries(your_project_name_here PRIVATE basic_math_operations)
```

# Usage

## Python
```py
import arithmetica

print(arithmetica.arcsin('0.5', 20))
```

## C

```c
#include "arithmetica.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int
main ()
{
  char input[] = "0.5";
  char *res = arcsin (input, 20); // 20 is the precision
  printf ("%s%s%s", "arcsin(0.5) = ", res,
          "\n"); // prints the inverse sine of 0.5

  free (res);

  return 0;
}
```
